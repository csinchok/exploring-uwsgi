# Exploring uWSGI

Some reference materials for my talk at ChiPy. Slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w1rd89cuAgFRx0PhN0Z35kQzJN5AwT2LzAP1Szwmwbk/edit?usp=sharing)

All example code is written in Python 3. To make sure you have the right dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then just cd to one of the folders, and follow the README.
