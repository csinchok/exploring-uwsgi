# HTTP

Documentation: [http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/HTTP.html](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/HTTP.html)

uWSGI can talk HTTP! This is very helpful. Try it out:

```bash
uwsgi --ini example.ini
```

Now you can just hit [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/) in your browser, or run:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1/
```
